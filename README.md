# CR-Bot
An open-source Clash Royale Discord Bot written in nodejs.
This bot is getting updates on a basis. You can use this bot's code for free, try to make cool stuff out of it and more. You do not have to credit me, but it would be greatly appreciated.

* aoi.js - v5.5.0 or above
* express - v4.18.1

# Features
- Simple battles.
- Profile. (includes viewing)
- Leaderboards.

# Short Tutorial
You will have to install the .zip file and ungroup it. You will have to create a bot on the Discord Developer Portal and copy it's token to get the bot to eventually work. If you have trouble with this, you can watch some YouTube tutorials. Then, run index.js in your console. You can also configurate the variable values in config.js.

# Supporting
You do not have to, but please, ‚≠ê this repository if you found it useful. This motivates me to continue providing useful updates to the bot!
